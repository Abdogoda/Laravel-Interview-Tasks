# 📦 Laravel Interview Tasks

Welcome to the **Laravel Interview Tasks** repository! 🚀  

This is a curated collection of **real-world Laravel coding tasks** often seen in technical interviews, coding assessments, and onboarding challenges.  
Each task is implemented inside its **own folder** and is **self-contained**, meaning you can work on any one task without setting up the entire repository.  

The goal of this repository is to:
- 🎯 Help Laravel developers **prepare for job interviews** by practicing realistic challenges
- 🏗 Provide **ready-to-run mini-projects** for learning and reference
- 💡 Demonstrate **best practices** in structuring Laravel projects

Whether you are a **beginner** trying to understand Laravel’s core features or an **experienced developer** brushing up on concepts before an interview, this repo has something for you.
